Title: Bird killing Game

Overview: The Bird Killer Game is a console-based adventure developed in C++, combining entertainment and programming practice. 
Players take on the role of a skilled bird hunter with the objective of eliminating various bird species
while navigating through challenging levels.

Key Features;

    Player-Controlled Shooter: 
    1. Utilize arrow keys for precise movement control. 
    2. Engage in the thrill of shooting birds using the spacebar.

    Diverse Bird Species: 
    1. Encounter a variety of bird types, each with unique flight patterns and behaviors. 
    2. From slow-soaring eagles to erratic sparrows, each species presents a different challenge.

    Score Tracking: 
    1. Accumulate points for each successful bird hit. 
    2. Experience the satisfaction of achieving a high score as you progress through the game.

    Progressive Difficulty Levels: 
    1. Face increasing challenges with each level, featuring faster and more elusive birds. 
    2. Test your skills as you advance through the game's dynamically adjusting difficulty curve.

    Console-Based Graphics: 
    
    1.Immerse yourself in the game's environment with simple yet effective console-based graphics. 
    2. Experience the excitement of the hunt within the constraints of a text-based interface.

Technical Details:

● Programming Language: C++ 

● Graphics Library: Console-based graphics for a minimalist and accessible visual experience. 

● Classes: Player, Bird, GameEngine, ScoreManager - encapsulating different aspects of the game logic

Game Mechanics:

● Player Controls:

   * Navigate the game using arrow keys for movement precision.
   * Engage in the hunt with intuitive spacebar shooting controls.

● Bird Behaviors:

   1. Encounter birds with randomized flight patterns, adding unpredictability to the gameplay.
   
   2.Adapt to different species exhibiting varying speeds and evasive maneuvers.

● Scoring System: 
1.Earn points for each successful hit. 

2.Strive for accuracy and consecutive hits to achieve a higher score

DEVELOPING GOALS:- The primary goals for developing the Bird Killer Game in C++ are to create engaging core gameplay mechanics with precise controls and shooting, introduce diverse bird species with unique behaviors, implement an effective score tracking system, design progressively challenging levels, utilize console-based graphics for a visually appealing experience, conduct iterative testing for player feedback, and ensure clean and modular code with comprehensive documentation. The focus is on providing a balanced and enjoyable gaming experience while fostering learning and skill improvement in C++.

Learning Outcomes:-
